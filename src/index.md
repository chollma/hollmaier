I’m a strategic and results-oriented digital product manager with proven success in optimizing online shopping experiences using innovative tactics and customer-centric solutions. Skilled in systems thinking, user experience design, and data analytics, I’ve led several cross-functional teams to efficiency gains and revenue growth in the SEO, Landing Page, and Accessibility spaces in my 5 years at REI.
