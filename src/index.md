## Who I am

I'm a product leader, speaker, and mentor. I advocate for systemic solutions to business and customer problems that are fast and accessible by default. You can find my work featured in [The A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/authors/), [A11y Weekly](https://a11yweekly.com/), and at [CSUN: The Assistive Technology Conference](https://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/sessions/index.php/public/presentations/view/1403).

- Diversity, equity, and inclusion
- Organizational change management
- Product management
- Assistive technologies
- Semantics and interoperability
