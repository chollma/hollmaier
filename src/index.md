## Who I am

I'm a empathetic problem solver, talented storyteller, and community builder. I'm insatiably curious, a dedicated systems thinker, and a seeker of adventure. I believe that accessibility is a human right worth fighting for.

Outside of work, you'll find me playing video games, biking, running, skiing and supporting local businesses.
